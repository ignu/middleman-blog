Thanks for everyone who came to my sessions at [MADExpo](http://madexpo.us/)!

If you came for JavaScript is Real Code, here’s my [previous post](/javascript-is-real-code-slides-and-sample) containg slides and code.

If you came for Getting Git, here’re my slides:

[Getting Git (pdf)](http://f.cl.ly/items/2w3B0V1p3q1n1v1n342y/getting%20git.pdf)

And some links containing topics that I mentioned.

[Random Git Goodness](/random-git-goodness) – some git tricks I mentioned.

[Git Extras](https://github.com/visionmedia/git-extras) - more sane git commands, worth it for git-delete-branch alone.

[Git Pull with Automatic Rebase](http://stevenharman.net/git-pull-with-automatic-rebase) - avoid merge bubbles when pulling from remote repositories
