**Glenn Vanderberg**: [Real Software Engineering](http://www.engineyard.com/v/16287115)
tl;dr: (Spoiler) Software Engineering as a concept is a joke, unless you're practicing Agile disciplines.
(This is the only software talk I've ever seen get a standing ovation)

**Uncle Bob Martin: **[The Renaissance of Craftmanship](http://archive.oredev.org/topmenu/video/keynotebobmartin.4.5a2d30d411ee6ffd28880002007.html)

tl;dr: Be less terrible.

**Jim Weirich**: [The Grand Unified Theory of Software Design](http://confreaks.net/videos/93-aac2009-the-grand-unified-theory)

tl;dr: Contranascenece is a word. Also, you have not begun to fathom the ways in which our code is coupled.

**J.B. Rainsberger**: [Integration Tests are a Scam](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/integration-tests-scam)
tl;dr: Integration Tests yield shitty ROI because of Math.

**Mary Poppendieck**: [Using Lean for Competitive Advantage](http://www.infoq.com/interviews/poppendieck-lean-2007)
tl;dr: Mary Poppendieck is the best ever

**Dan North**: [Simplicty, The Way of the unusual Architect](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simplicity-Architect)

**Uncle Bob Martin**: [Twenty-Five Zeros](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mslMLp5bQD0)
tl;dr: Your modern language isn't much better than Fortran

** (I couldn't resist putting the same artist twice on mix tapes either) **

Did I miss any?
